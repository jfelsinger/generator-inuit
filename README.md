# generator-inuit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jfelsinger/generator-inuit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfelsinger/generator-inuit)

This is a very basic generator for applications based on the [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) css framework. Given my inexperience with Grunt and Yeoman a lot of things were based heavily off of [generator-mobile](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mobile) because it acted as a good starting point at times.

## Getting Started

* `npm install -g generator-inuit` install the generator!
* `yo inuit` run the generator!
* `grunt` build your site
* `grunt serve` create a local server and serve that bad-boi
